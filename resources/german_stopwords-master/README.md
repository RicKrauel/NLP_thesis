# german_stopwords
Extended list of German stopwords for use in Web Projects, Search Engines or everything else.

## Content
__german_stopwords_plain.txt__

A plain stopword list containing only "real" stopwords. A real stopword is limited to actual short function words like "der, die, das, mit, und, oder, denn, dann, ..." but without any nouns.

__german_stopwords_full.txt__ 

The definition of this enhanced List is more loose, it contains stopwords + unwanted words. This list can contain nouns which are often used in a descriptive way without having a huge impact of the sentence meaning in e.g. search phrases.


## Contribution
Feel free to add and/or update the lists. Be sure to keep the lists sorted alphabetically.

This sorting can be achieved either by a sorting capable Text editor (VSC,Sublime,NP++) or via Command Line Tools. Alternative to this you could use [this](https://www.online-utility.org/text/sort.jsp) online Sort Tool. Always be sure only to Sort the Lines without the Comment Header.
