I edited the sourced stopwords list and removed any negations, since these contain emotions that I want to capture later in the workflow. Afterwards, the remaining tokenized words for each comment are lemmatized, i.e. reduced to their basic form. In order to do this I utilise the 'Hannover Tagger', which also provides part of speech information, although I do not use it (the main reason that I do not use the PoS information is that the utilised German emotion and sentiment lexical use different PoS abbreviations, resulting in no matches)."
